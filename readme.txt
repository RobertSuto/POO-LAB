# Medical Records Management System

This project contains four main classes: **PACIENT**, **PERSONAL**, **DEZINFECTANT**, and **MEDICAMENT**. Both **Pacient** and **Personal** classes include all necessary variables, constructors, destructors, and method overloads.

## Features

- Upon execution, the project displays a menu, which is not yet fully completed, as it's uncertain whether it should only be present in the third phase or from now on.
- You can add a **Personal** and a **Pacient** from it, delete them as needed, and display their information.
- **Note:** There is an issue with the program entering a loop when providing a multi-word name (still working on fixing this), and the program crashes if you attempt to delete a **Personal** before adding one.

In essence, in the main program, we can currently use only the **Pacient** and **Personal** classes, while the other two classes are not integrated into the menu. (Again, it's unclear if they should be included only in the third phase or from this point onward).
